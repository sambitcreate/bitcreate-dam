Okay, let's outline how to use the Jewelry DAM system you've been building.

Assumptions:

    You have successfully built and run the application using Docker Compose (docker-compose up).
    All containers (frontend, backend, database, MinIO) are running without errors.
    You can access the frontend at http://localhost:3090.
    You have created the jewelrydam bucket in MinIO.

Basic Usage Steps:

    Access the Frontend:
        Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3090. You should see the main application interface.

    Navigate the Application:
        Use the navigation links in the sidebar to access different sections of the application:
            Dashboard: This is a placeholder for a future dashboard.
            Assets: This is where you manage your jewelry photos.
            Transfers: This is a placeholder for a future file transfer management section.

    Manage Assets:
        View Assets: In the "Assets" section, you'll see a table listing the existing assets. The table displays the asset's name, tags, creation date, and actions.
        Create New Asset:
            Click the "Create New Asset" button. This will open a modal.
            Fill in the form:
                Name: Enter a descriptive name for the asset.
                Description: Enter a description for the asset.
                Tags: Enter comma-separated tags to categorize the asset (e.g., "ring", "gold", "diamond").
                JPG File: Upload the JPG version of the image. This is required.
                TIFF File (Optional): Upload the TIFF version of the image (if available).
            Click the "Create Asset" button.

    Verify Asset Creation:
        After creating a new asset, the table in the "Assets" section should update to include the new asset.
        Check MinIO: Access the MinIO console at http://localhost:9001 and log in with the credentials from your docker-compose.yml file. Verify that the JPG (and TIFF, if uploaded) file has been uploaded to the jewelrydam bucket in a directory named assets.
        Check the Database: Connect to your MySQL database and query the assets table to verify that the asset metadata has been stored correctly.

Detailed Explanation of the Workflow:

    User Accesses Frontend: The user opens the web application in their browser.
    Frontend Fetches Assets (Initially): The Assets component in the frontend makes a request to the backend API (http://localhost:3091/api/assets) to retrieve a list of existing assets.
    Backend Retrieves Assets: The backend API queries the MySQL database to retrieve the asset metadata.
    Backend Returns Assets: The backend API returns the asset metadata to the frontend as a JSON response.
    Frontend Displays Assets: The Assets component displays the asset metadata in a table.
    User Creates New Asset: The user clicks the "Create New Asset" button and fills in the form.
    Frontend Sends Asset Data: The Assets component sends a POST request to the backend API (http://localhost:3091/api/assets) with the asset metadata and the image files.
    Backend Receives Asset Data: The backend API receives the asset metadata and the image files.
    Backend Uploads Files to MinIO: The backend API uploads the image files to the MinIO server.
    Backend Stores Metadata in MySQL: The backend API stores the asset metadata in the MySQL database.
    Backend Returns Success Response: The backend API returns a success response to the frontend.
    Frontend Refreshes Asset List: The Assets component refreshes the list of assets by making another request to the backend API.

Next Steps and Future Features:

This is a basic DAM system with limited functionality. Here are some potential next steps and future features:

    Implement Search and Filtering: Add search and filtering capabilities to the Assets component to allow users to easily find specific assets.
    Implement WeTransfer Integration: Integrate with the WeTransfer API to allow users to send files to clients for review.
    Implement User Authentication and Authorization: Add user authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain features based on user roles.
    Implement a Client Review System: Allow clients to review and provide feedback on the assets.
    Implement Automated Image Processing: Add automated image processing capabilities, such as resizing, watermarking, and format conversion.
    Implement Activity Logs: Track user activity and log important events.
    Implement Automated Backup System: Set up an automated backup system to protect your data.
